## Abstract

#### Background
Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein-32A (ANP32A) is a novel regulator of histone H3 acetylation and promotes leukemogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, its prognostic value in AML remains unclear.

#### Methods
In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of ANP32A expression using two independent large cohorts of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients. Multivariable analysis in CN-AML group was also presented. Based on the ANP32A expression, its related genes, dysregulation of pathways, interaction network analysis between microRNAs and target genes, as well as methylation analysis were performed to unveil the complex functions behind ANP32A.

#### Results
Here we demonstrated overexpression of ANP32A was notably associated with unfavorable outcome in two independent cohorts of CN-AML patients (OS: P=0.012, EFS: P=0.005, n=185; OS: P=0.041, n=232), as well as in European Leukemia Net (ELN) Intermediate-I group (OS: P=0.018, EFS: P=0.045, n=115), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Intermediate Risk AML group (OS: P=0.048, EFS: P=0.039, n=225), and non-M3 AML group (OS: P=0.034, EFS: P=0.011, n=435). Multivariable analysis further validated ANP32A as a high-risk factor in CN-AML group. Multi-omics analysis presented overexpression of ANP32A was associated with aberrant expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor, up/down-regulation of metabolic and immune-related pathways, dysregulation of microRNAs, and hypomethylation on CpG island and 1st Exon regions.

#### Conclusions
We proved ANP32A as a novel, potential unfavorable prognosticator and therapeutic target for AML.
